# Password-Checker

This is an easy to use password checker which helps you see if your password has been used or been hacked into.
You can make this even safer for yourself by making this program check your password through a notepad 
as the command prompt/ terminal through which this program works through, tends to be saved into the computer.
Although this is safe, you can take that extra step to make it all the more safer. So that after you run the 
notepad file you can just delete it to get rid of it completely.

If you have a query or are facing an issue with the code,
